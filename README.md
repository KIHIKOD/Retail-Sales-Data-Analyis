## Process Taken to Build the PowerBI Project
-	Imported raw data from multiple sources (e.g., Excel, CSV) into Power BI.
-	Integrated data from various tables including sales transactions, customer details, and product information into a unified data model.
-	Utilized Power Query to clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and creating calculated fields.
-	Transformed the data to ensure consistency and enable effective cross-table analysis.
-	Established relationships between key tables to build a robust data model.
-	Developed DAX measures and calculated columns to derive key performance indicators such as total sales, average order value, and profit margins.
-	Designed interactive reports and dashboards using various visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and slicers.
-	Enabled dynamic filtering to allow users to explore data by region, product category, time period, and customer segments.
-	Analyzed visualizations to identify trends, high-performing segments, and areas with growth potential.
-	Compiled key findings into a comprehensive dashboard for easy interpretation by stakeholders.

## Project Insights 
-	Specific product categories have emerged as the primary revenue generators.
-	A distinct group of high-value customers contributes a significant share of overall sales, notably the professional labourers.
-	Certain geographic regions outperform others, indicating potential areas for market expansion.
-	Sales trends reveal seasonal fluctuations that can guide inventory and marketing strategies; for example, product purchases peaked in 2013 and were lowest in 2012, showing a growth trend from 2010 to 2013 followed by a steady decline after 2013.
-	Among Spanish Occupants, the professional labourers owned the highest number of cars.
  
## Final Conclusion
The comprehensive analysis of our retail sales data highlights the significant influence of professional labourers as a high-value customer segment. Not only do they drive a substantial share of overall sales, but their distinct purchasing patterns—evident in both seasonal trends and regional preferences—present a unique opportunity.
Targeting professional labourers with tailored marketing strategies, specialized product offerings, and personalized promotions can further enhance customer loyalty and drive sustained revenue growth. By aligning our market initiatives with the needs of this key group, we can effectively capitalize on their buying power and secure a stronger competitive position in the market.
